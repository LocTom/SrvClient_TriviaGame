# SrvClient_TriviaGame
The two python files here include the server adn the client files.
As can be seen the client has almsot no information or code in it and almost evreything is done in the backend to keep the game more secure.

This project was done to show simple communication between server and client in an effective way and with sockets.

In order to run the game replace the ip adress in the server with your own and run the client and the server on the same ot diffrent computers.
You can connect multiple clients at once.
Enjoy!
